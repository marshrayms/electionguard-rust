S3.6.1,"Josh 2025-03-19: Though EGRS refers to ""populat[ing] the election record with the sets of aggregated ballots"", this simply refers to the set of Ballots in the `Cast` state, i.e., participating in a tally. There is a set of Ballots in the `Challenged` state (""marked to be challenged""), but they are not 'aggregated' and do not participate in any Tally (i.e., eq. 80 pg. 45). So really there is only ever a single ""set of aggregated ballots"" relevant to a specific Tally."
