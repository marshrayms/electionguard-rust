6588,S4.1,"pg. 58 QUESTION: How are they ""combined""? E.g., are these multiple encryptions combined such that there is still a single vector `Psi_{i,m}` for Option `i`, or are there additional Option vectors? Note: [S4.1.4 pg. 63] says ""For contests with selection limit greater than 1, the selection vectors published in the election record match the product of the pre-encryptions associated with the short codes listed as selected"", which seems to imply they are multiplied."
6589,S4.1,"pg. 58 QUESTION: What about when the effective Option Selection Limit is greater than `1`? Do all possible assignments within the effective (Option and Contest) Selection Limits require distinct Selection Vectors and Selection Hashes? E.g. say a Contest has two options and the Contest and Option Selection Limits are all `5`. How is the selection vector constructed which allows the voter to apply a value of `3` to Option 1 and `2` to Option 2?"

These removable ballot codes are intended to be retained by voters and can be used as an identifier to allow voters to look up their (encrypted) ballots in the election record and confirm that they include the proper short codes as described below."""

QUESTION: Does this imply that there is a point during the tally process at which generated-but-not-cast `PreencryptedBallots` are no longer accepted? If there are multiple Tallys taken, then it seems really important that this only happen at the final Tally. Someone who submitted a PreencryptedBallot that was somehow delayed in the mail probably does not want their Voter Selections made public."
